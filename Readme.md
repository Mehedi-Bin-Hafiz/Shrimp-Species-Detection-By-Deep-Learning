# Bangladeshi Shrimp Species Detection Using Deep Learning

A deep learning-powered computer vision system to accurately identify and classify four major Bangladeshi shrimp species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## ü¶ê Overview

Shrimp, known as "white gold" in Bangladesh, constitutes about 70% of the country's exported agricultural food and represents the second-largest export item. This project addresses the common confusion in identifying different shrimp species by developing an intelligent machine learning system that can accurately recognize shrimp species.

**Research Paper**: [A Deep Learning Approach to Recognize Bangladeshi Shrimp Species](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375874920_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_to_Recognize_Bangladeshi_Shrimp_Species)

## üéØ Problem Statement

In Bangladesh, approximately 56 shrimp species are found, but most people, including fishermen, struggle to differentiate between species due to their similar appearances. The most commonly confused pairs are:
- **Golda** and **Bagda** (similar appearance)
- **Horina** and **Deshi** (similar appearance)

This confusion affects:
- Export quality control
- Species-specific pricing
- Market standardization
- Prevention of fraudulent mixing of species

## üêæ Target Species

The system identifies four major Bangladeshi shrimp species:

1. **Bagda** - High-value export species
2. **Deshi** - Local freshwater variety
3. **Golda** - Premium freshwater prawns
4. **Horina** - Marine shrimp variety

## üß† Model Architecture

Three custom CNN architectures were developed and compared:

### Model 1 (Complex Architecture)
- **Layers**: 12 convolutional layers
- **Features**: BatchNormalization, mixed pooling (AvgPool2D + MaxPool2D)
- **Accuracy**: 99.01%
- **Epochs**: 44

### Model 2 (Intermediate Architecture)
- **Layers**: 10 convolutional layers
- **Features**: MaxPool2D only
- **Accuracy**: 98.97%
- **Epochs**: 31

### Model 3 (Lightweight Architecture) ‚≠ê **SELECTED**
- **Layers**: 8 convolutional layers
- **Features**: Alternating Conv2D and MaxPool2D
- **Accuracy**: 99.01%
- **Epochs**: 45
- **Test Accuracy**: 98%

**Why Model 3?** Despite having the same training accuracy as Model 1, Model 3 demonstrated superior performance on the test dataset while being more lightweight and computationally efficient.

## üìä Dataset

- **Total Images**: 38,042 (after augmentation)
- **Original Images**: 11,500
- **Classes**: 4 (Bagda, Deshi, Golda, Horina)
- **Background**: Black and white backgrounds
- **Data Split**: Training/Validation/Test
- **Test Images**: 3,122

### Data Augmentation Techniques
- Rotation
- Angle adjustment
- Various transformations to increase dataset diversity

## üéØ Performance Metrics

### Model 3 (Final Model) Performance:

| Species | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
